# PingMe - Messaging Application for Android 📱

**PingMe** is a lightweight Android messaging app built with Jetpack Compose and Firebase. Currently, the app focuses on the **chat feature**, while other screens are placeholders for future updates.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:**
>
> - Currently, only the **Chat** feature is fully functional.
> - Other screens (Calls, Contacts, Settings, Profile) are **dummy/static**.
> - Firebase OTP is a **paid service**, so for testing purposes, you can sign in with:
>   - **Phone:** `+91 9999999999`
>   - **OTP:** `123459`
>   - **Phone:** `+91 8888888888`
>   - **OTP:** `123459`
> - All of these will be fixed and fully implemented in **v1.0 release**.
